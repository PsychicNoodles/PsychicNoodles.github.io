Welcome to my website! I am Mattori Birnbaum, an American software developer/engineer living in Japan. My main professional experience is in full-stack web development, but I'm always open to exploring new areas in software. I also love speaking Japanese and navigating my way through life as a non-native speaker in Japan. I currently work for [Reaktor Japan](https://www.reaktor.com/) as a software consultant. I sometimes program as a hobby as well, and when I do I usually use the Rust programming language to solve minor annoyances in life that probably have better solutions with positive ROI but are fun to work on anyway.

My current main hobby is Final Fantasy XIV, an MMORPG entry in the FF series. My interests in FFXIV range from high-end Savage and Ultimates to Deep Dungeons to big fishing.

Historically I'm not very good at maintaining writing hobbies for a long period of time, but this site will serve as a place for when I feel like putting my thoughts into words.
