## Pandæmonium

The story after defeating Kokytos is, in short, we encountered Athena, who in the ancient past attempted to sacrifice her son to ascend to godhood and was supposed to have been struck down. She has been waiting to be revived and continue her plans, and she creates more barriers for us to overcome so that she can observe and further her understanding of the soul. Thus, Pandæmonium, the building itself, is granted life and becomes the boss for the second floor fight.

Since the name of the raid series itself is also Pandæmonium, I liked to refer to this boss as John Pandemonium[^john]. Unfortunately, this joke does not translate well into Japanese.

The song for this fight is also "One Amongst the Weary," and like last time you can find an [unofficial lyrics video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K4IaMLcoqs).

## Mechanics

This is an overall fast-paced fight with a couple rather unique gimmicks. The main one is the use of webs, where when hit by specific attacks players and some objects in the field can be bound together by webs. Players who are webbed cannot move, will take damage over time, and will eventually be insta-killed if not freed in time, which is accomplished by another player walking through their web. Webs can also at certain points be used to make bridges or walls. It's not clear to me how the building → magic building → magic spider building thought process came about, but it definitely made for a fun encounter!

The other thing to note is the two side platforms on the left and right. As mentioned above and explored below, these areas can be connected to the main stage through web bridges. Most stages are either plain circles or squares, so the addition of these parts and their usage through the mechanics makes solving this fight very interesting.

Similar to in P9S, we settled on [the game8 guide](https://game8.jp/ff14/532718). Originally we referenced Nukemaru's video, but the playerbase trended away from that strategy in some minor but important ways, such as resolving one mechanic on just the left platform rather than utilizing both sides.

## Ultima

The raid-wide of choice for this fight, with an added DoT[^dot] for good measure. In the context of the Final Fantasy series, this stands out as tending to be an attack reserved for last bosses. In the story for the raid series, it's specifically mentioned that Athena is powerful enough to have granted such a legendary ability to her underling.

As a sidenote, you'll often see raid-wides in videos like this not seeming particularly threatening; in its first usage at the start, it only scratches my health bar. However, it's important to remember that this is only thanks to a combination of shielding and mitigation, and the usage of these tools given the resources they consume and cooldown timers is determined through trial and error (and sometimes a little spreadsheeting) during practice. Especially at the beginning of the fight when everyone's at full resources these hits do very little, but trust me when I say Ultima is pretty scary when you're in the middle of the fight and one healer's on the ground.

## Soul Grasp

The very metal sounding tankbuster for this fight. The normal way of handling this requires personal defensive cooldowns from both tanks sharing the damage, but since it only targets one tank invulns are also solutions. It's said that all mechanics are designed such that you never are required to use an invuln, but at the same time considering many tankbusters, including this one, come more frequently than normal defensive cooldowns are available it's much more efficient and easier to plan to use invulns.

Since this hits four times, if the tank dies midway through then another target is chosen, which leads to a very funny situation where four players are assassinated in quick succession with laser precision.

## Dividing Wings + Heavy Web

First, two wings are placed on the field. When Heavy Web goes off, these wings will tether to a random tank/healer and a random DPS and shortly after deliver a conal attack that also applies a DoT. Heavy Web itself also targets a random tank/healer and a random DPS for a circular three player stack each, but this one has the added effect of webbing the players together. The basic solution is to have the wing players angle their cones away from the party and then after that go free the webbed players.

As simple as this is, there are actually a few different possible variations on where everyone stands. I've read that in the NA and EU regions some groups have the wing players go left and right or south, where melee players can still just barely hit the boss. I've only tried the version from the image above, but personally I like that way since it allows everyone to easily continue attacking the boss without excessive movement.

[^john]: This in turn is a reference to how the character used for FFXIV box art and media that represents the player character does not have a canonical name, so people like to call him John Finalfantasy.

[^dot]: Short for Damage over Time. A common part of player toolkits and used a bit less frequently by bosses, this tends to require a bit more work to mitigate and heal than just one big hit since the effect takes longer to fully complete and therefore be able to fully recover from.
